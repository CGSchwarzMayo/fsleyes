.. _troubleshooting_keyboard_navigation_doesnt_work_in_the_ic_classification_panel:

Keyboard navigation doesn't work in the IC classification panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under OSX, you may have focus-related issues while navigating around the
:ref:`IC classification panel
<ic_classification_classifying_components_with_the_classification_panel>` with
the keyboard.

If this is happening to you, you may need to enable *Full keyboard access* for
the melodic classification panel to work with keyboard navigation/focus.  This
setting can be changed through *System Preferences* |right_arrow| *Keyboard*
|right_arrow| *Shortcuts*, and changing *Full Keyboard Access* to *All
controls*.
